# Package your Electron application into a executable file with electron-builder


## CCNokes

We’ve been running our app in a development environment using the
Electron executable. Now let’s learn how to package our app into a
.app or .exe file so that we can distribute it to other users.

Electron doesn't provide this functionality out of the box, so we'll
use a popular and easy-to-use npm package called
electron-builder
to handle the details.
electron-builder
will automatically grab our .ico or .icns file and use that as our app's icon.
